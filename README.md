## Overview

### Description

FocusFlow is a smart productivity tracking mobile application designed to help users manage their daily work and study routines. Leveraging the popular Pomodoro technique along with custom timer sessions, FocusFlow enables users to:
- **Plan & Track**: Create, edit, or delete daily goals and to-do items.

- **Focus Sessions**: Initiate focus sessions with adjustable timers (Pomodoro-style or custom duration), pause/resume functionality, and optional break intervals.

- **Session Logging**: Automatically record details about when, where, and for how long sessions occur.

- **Media & Location**: Upload workspace photos and note down session details, with automatic location logging using MapKit.

- **Motivation & Analytics**: Receive a daily motivational quote and observe productivity trends via session logs and a streak tracker.

The application integrates with Firebase for user authentication and data storage (Firestore), uses a REST API for dynamic content like quotes, and optionally employs Parse for enhanced media handling.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Productivity / Life-Management
- **Mobile:** Designed as a mobile-first app with potential web integration later.
- **Story:**  FocusFlow tells the story of a daily journey to improved focus and productivity. Users start their day by planning tasks, engaging in dedicated focus sessions, and reviewing their progress with visual location and session logs.
- **Market:** Targeted at students, remote workers, freelancers, and any professionals seeking to boost their daily productivity and form lasting focus habits.
- **Habit:** Designed for daily use with features that promote routine building (e.g., streak trackers and daily motivational quotes).
- **Scope:** Initially a narrow MVP focusing on core productivity features with scalability options into additional functionalities (e.g., enhanced analytics, integrations with other productivity tools).
