# App Ideas

**Idea One:**

:::success
Bullet Journal
:::
**What**
We live in a day and age where getting up and taking on "simple" tasks may seem impossible. With the bullet journal you can create a lists of things that you wish to complete and turn it into a goal setting adventure to have done by the end of the day. 

**Who**
Students, parents, the layman, those with mental illness, and learning disabilities could benefit from a visual reminder of what they would like to accomplish in their day to day. 

**Why**
Physical bullet journals have been really popular on social media but take time to create. It is common for people to take up to a month creating an outline of what the journal should look like before beginning to put it to use. Having a virtual premade one makes it easier for the users to jot down their tasks.

**Challenges**
The way to differentiate the bullet journal from your ordinary platform would be to have more customization and a trigger that makes users want to keep coming to the app. Some apps do this by having the user take care of a companion as they complete the tasks. I would like to implement a monthly theme that changes and can even expand and become more prominent/vibrant as users continue on with their daily tasks.


**Idea Two**
:::success
MovieTime
:::
**What**
MovieTime gives real time updates on what movies are popular in their local theaters. It will showcase how packed a theater might be and a general probability on best times to go to the movies depending on the users group and setting. 

**Who**
The avid movie goer likely has a preferred setting when watching specific movies. This app is for them. Whether they are shy and would like to be in an empty theater or extroverted and wanting to be with a bustling crowd that comments about the movie while it is playing.

**Why**
There is a time and place for anyone to get the best time out of the movies. Howard University has private screenings where students can laugh and joke while the movie is playing. This could be replicated for more people who would enjoy that scene when watching a horror or comedy. Some people may also feel too shy to go movies alone if it is crowded. Lastly people may want to feel free to express themselves in an empty theater so they can laugh as loud as they please.

**Challenges**
It may be difficult to pull the data of theaters to see how busy they are without paying for API access. Another issue may arise with how often this data would need to be pulled so that it isnt too overpowering to the machine but frequent enough to be relevant.

**Idea Three**

:::success
FoodTube
:::
**What**
FoodTube is a video-based app dedicated to all things food. It would serve as a platform where users can upload, share, and watch food-related content—ranging from recipe tutorials and cooking techniques to restaurant reviews and food challenges.

**Who**
The app targets food enthusiasts, home cooks, professional chefs, and anyone passionate about culinary arts. Whether someone is looking for inspiration in the kitchen or enjoys watching creative food content, FoodTube caters to a broad audience of food lovers.

**Why**
The goal is to create a focused community that goes beyond generic video platforms by curating high-quality culinary content. With specialized features like step-by-step guides, ingredient lists, and perhaps even integration with grocery services, FoodTube offers a unique value proposition—making it easier for users to not only discover great recipes but also to try them out.

**Challenges**
There could be difficulties ensuring that videos maintain quality and comply with copyright and food safety standards.We would also need to focus on balancing features for content creators and viewers to keep the community active and vibrant. Another challenge would be handling video streaming, data storage, and ensuring smooth performance across multiple devices.

**Idea Four**

:::success
Campaign Forge
:::



**What**
Campaign Forge is a digital companion app tailored for Dungeons & Dragons enthusiasts. It offers features such as customizable digital character sheets, a dynamic dice roller, interactive campaign maps, and a repository of spells, items, and monsters. Additionally, the app includes tools for campaign management and a community forum where players and Dungeon Masters can share story ideas, homebrew content, and game tips.

**Who**
This app is designed for both D&D players and Dungeon Masters—from newcomers looking for an easy entry point to experienced gamers seeking to streamline their campaign management. It caters to those who appreciate the blend of storytelling, strategy, and community engagement that Dungeons & Dragons offers.

**Why**
Campaign Forge is built to enhance the traditional tabletop experience by providing digital tools that simplify game management and enrich storytelling. It aims to help users keep track of their campaigns, manage character progression, and explore creative content, all while fostering a vibrant community where ideas and experiences are shared.

**Challenges**
Navigating intellectual property rights related to Dungeons & Dragons content may bring up challenges. I think the project scope is too large for the timeframe, but that lets it have good scalability.I would want to create an intuitive interface that accommodates both the extensive features required by veteran players and the ease-of-use demanded by beginners.

**Idea Five**

:::success
Dungeon Lore Keeper
:::

**What**
Dungeon Lore Keeper is a collaborative world-building and lore management app designed for Dungeons & Dragons enthusiasts. It allows Dungeon Masters and players to create, organize, and share intricate campaign histories, character backstories, magical artifacts, and detailed maps of fantasy realms.

**Who**
This app is made for Dungeon Masters looking to maintain rich, detailed lore for their campaigns, as well as for players who want to keep track of their characters’ development and the evolving narrative. It caters to both seasoned storytellers and newcomers who appreciate immersive role-playing experiences.

**Why**
Many D&D campaigns generate extensive lore that can be difficult to track over multiple sessions. Dungeon Lore Keeper centralizes all this information in one accessible place, making it easier to reference past events, develop future plotlines, and keep players engaged with a shared, evolving narrative. By fostering a collaborative storytelling environment, the app enhances the overall gaming experience.

**Challenges**
tructuring vast amounts of text, images, maps, and other multimedia content so that it remains easily navigable could become a challenge. I think that there may be a challenge implementing effective real-time collaboration features, including version control and permissions, to handle inputs from multiple users simultaneously.
